# Mental Treat


## Description
Mental Treat (MT) was founded by four (4) university juniors: Israel Oyekan, Janeil Speid, Franklin Maradiaga and Pericles Gadri. MT was created with procrastinators in mind who struggle to complete all ranges of tasks. It is a platform to record to do lists, goals or any tasks you want to tackle. This website uses the art of not knowing to drive our little procrastinators to productivity and success. The art of not knowing is done by having a pop up at the end of each completed task listed with a random activity. In addition, after accomplishing all the tasks or waking up to do so,it is only right that the mind gets to rest and heal. MT recognizes this and dedicated a part of its website to meditating and taking care of the mental health by giving the user exclusive access to meditation sounds that prove to do wonders. At MT, your success and mental care is our priority and we pledge to do our best to let that be possible.
